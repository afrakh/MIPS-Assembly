🖥️ MIPS Assembly & Final Datapath Design 

This repository contains a collection of **MIPS assembly programs** and the **datapath implementation** developed as part of the **CS-221: Computer Organization and Design** course.

It showcases fundamental and intermediate-level concepts in computer architecture, including instruction execution, memory access, control flow and an implementation of a non-pipelined data path.

You can run .asm files using either MARS or QtSPIM
